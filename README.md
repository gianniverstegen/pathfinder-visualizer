## Pathfinder algorithms included:
- Dijkstra's
- 3 A*-like algorithms
- DFS
- Greedy Search

## Features:
- Place start- and end point.
- Place walls and weights.
- Change the position of the end node after the algorithm has finished visualizing, to quickly view other results. 
- Maze generation using recursive division.
